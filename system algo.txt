            NOTES
*Image JS*
1. created an input with a style display none
2. get the id of the button and the input,
    then add an eventlistener to the button so that if you click it, you would also click the input at the same time
3. include the id of the main image div in the .KphotoRequirements div:not() para mo dissapear sya
4. create a function that shows the filename of the selected image
5.


*Pagination Algo*
1. create variables 
    for storing the number of records per page,
    for storing the page number and
    for storing the offset

    -the offset is the indicator of where do you want to start fetching records
    - to get the offset you need a formula of

        offset = pageNumber * number of records

*Pagination Bug*
-After adding, editing or deleting it goes back to page 1
    solution: create a variable that stores the currentpage, store the page in that variable

*How to fetch data in two differemt elements using ajax
-create fetch.php
-concatinate both information and store in oone variable, then echo
-use .split at the response in ajax
-assign variables by calling the array element
